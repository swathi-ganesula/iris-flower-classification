# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project implements a Machine Learning classification model
to predict iris flower species using a Decision Tree algorithm.

## Problem Statement
Build a Decision Tree classifier to classify iris flowers into
Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
- Iris dataset
- 150 samples
- 4 numerical features
- 3 target classes

## Features
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Model Used
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Visualized feature relationships
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree model
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy

## Result
The Decision Tree model successfully learned feature-based rules
and achieved high accuracy on the test dataset.
